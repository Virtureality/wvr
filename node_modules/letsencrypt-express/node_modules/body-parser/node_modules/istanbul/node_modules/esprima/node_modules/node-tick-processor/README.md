node-tick-processor
===================

easy-to-install processor for the v8 profiler log

This is little more than a repackaging of the "tick processor" that ships with the v8 source code.


## Installation
`$ npm install node-tick-processor`


## Usage
* Run your script with profiling enabled, to generate the `v8.log` file
    * `$ node --prof myscript.js`
* In the same directory, run this script
    * `$ node-tick-processor`

For help, add the `--help` flag.


## Contributing
* checkout your own copy of the source (or make a fork first)
* edit `header.js` as desired
* run `./rebuild.sh`
* submit changes in a github issue (or pull request)
