## command line

If `ljs` is installed globally,
you can use `ljs` command line tool to process your literate javascript files

```sh
$ ljs -c -o foo.md foo.js
$ ljs --help
```

### library

You can also use *grunt-literate* as a normal library:

```js
var documentation = require("grunt-literate")("hello.js", { code: true });
```

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.
Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
Make a pull request, but don't commit `README.md`!

## Related work

This task could be abused to do literate programming.
[Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/) is similar tool,
however *ljs* is markup-language-agnostic.
